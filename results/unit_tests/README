*** Small unit tests for fast triplexator (bit-parallel) ***

HowTo:
    - get inspired from the example test directories, such as "test_1"
    - to create and run a new test:
        = just make a new directory with any name, e.g., "mytest"
        = create a dna.data (double strand) and rna.data (single strand) input files, fasta format
        = run triplexator with "brute force (default mode)" on this input, and name the output file "reference_lMIN--MAX_cXY_eCD.tpx"
        = run TRIPLEXATOR_HOME/scripts/master_run.py --unit-test="mytest"

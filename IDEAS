1) Instead of doing q-gram search / match for every position in the haystack, upon a hit, move |q-gram| and start from there. Anything inbetween will be added during the seed-extension phase.

Useful algorithms / problems
1) longest common extension
2) k-mismatch:  - P, T, fixed number of k errors, a k-mismatch of P is: a substring of T that matches P with at most k mismatches. O(k*|T|)
                - speedup for DNA: generate all possible P' by changing k chars of P and search for each P' in the ST/SA of T


=== TO TEST ===
1) several tts sequences in input file
2) different c-s (consecutive errors, not yet impl.?)
